## **During Development Testing**
During the development process, I was manually testing in the following ways:-

1. Manually testing each element for appearance and responsiveness via a simulated live server using an extension in VSCode.
    
1. Published the page via GitHub pages and shared with fellow students to test and received feedback.

1. Created a post on linked in and asked my network of over 400 developers to review the site and report any issues. The post was viewed more than 1200 times and no issues were reported back in the comments.

### ***Manual Testing:***
* During testing, I used four different browsers to ensure cross-compatibility. The desktop browsers used by myself were:

  1. Chrome
  2. Firefox  
  3. Opera
  4. Edge

* I then used the devtools to simulate different screen sizes/devices from 320 px up to 4000px in width. 
* In addition to this, I also asked several people to test using iPhones and Apple Mac laptops/desktops using safari. These users reported no issues or bugs only style suggestions.
