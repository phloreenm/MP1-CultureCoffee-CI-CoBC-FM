## Accessibility
    - [Acces]():
    - [Landmarks](https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2016/05/27/using-navigation-landmarks/)Internet Explorer 11, which does not have accessibility support for the HTML5 elements used to provide landmarks, but which does support the equivalent ARIA roles.

## Performance
    1. To improve loading speed, I used *.webp image format  (https://developers.google.com/speed/webp)
    2. Images were resized to 768px for the long side. This resolution is enough to display good images for breakpoint-md: 768px. On large screens the gallery is presented as a grid of images, but as the width of the screen is lowered, the grid adapts to 2 or 1 column images.
## Issues
    - [Contact Page legend text centering](): an issue I had was centering the legend element, which wasn't easy achievable through css, because of the cross browsers incompatibility. There an in-line property solved it (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-legend-align-attribute/).
