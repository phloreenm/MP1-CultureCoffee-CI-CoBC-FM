## **UX (User Experience)**

### **User Stories**
I decided to display the User Story in a table (also a link at the bottom of the table). Since some user stories (like First time user and Existing User) might actually follow the same 

|As a/an|  I want to...| So that I can...|Scenario 1|Scenario 2|Acceptance Criteria
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**First time user**|**Existing User**|**Bussiness**||||
|&#10003;|&#10003;|   |find café's location|drink a coffee in the café|  Decided to visit the shop |   |   |

## **UI (User Interface)**

### ** Accessibility **

    - In mobile view the main navigation bar is hidden behind an icon. The icon has normally applied a bouncing effect, but to avoid vestibular motion triggers the animation is reduced (in media queries section of the css file), when the user has disabled such effects.
    - 
    - Mark up different regions of web pages and applications, so that they can be identified by web browsers and assistive technologies.

===========================================
## **Issues**
    - Hover effects won't work properly on touch mobile devices (which are using a touch screen), so a media query for that has to be implemented.




# Features

##  **Code Snipets:**
    1. Header layout and effects inspired from here: https://www.codinglabweb.com/2020/12/responsive-navigation-card-bar-design.html
    2. Content flexbox cards code sourced from here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJjej5udWVE
## **Research and Information:** 
    - [Coffee Types List](https://www.baristainstitute.com/blog/emmi-kinnunen/january-2022/affogato-ristretto-list-most-common-coffee-drinks)
    - [Things All Restaurant Website Designs Need to Include](https://pos.toasttab.com/blog/on-the-line/7-things-restaurant-websites-need-to-include): as highlithed in this article, having some specific sections on your restaurand (cafe in our case), improves a lot the customer experience and the chances of attracting new customers raises. 

## **Improve Customer services**
    IMPROVING CUSTOMERS SERVICES POLL - 
        How often do you use our products?

    Which features are most valuable to you
    How would you compare our products to our competitors’?
    What important features are we missing?
    What are you trying to solve by using our product?
    What other types of people could find our product useful?
    How easy is it to use our product?
    How would you rate the value for money?
    How likely are you to recommend this product to others?
    How could we improve our product to better meet your needs? 
## **Accessibility**
    - [Acces](): Navigation card items contain a Boostrap class .sr-only which indicates to screen readers at which page we are, helping visualy impaired users navigating throught the website using screen readers.
    - [Landmarks](https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2016/05/27/using-navigation-landmarks/)Internet Explorer 11, which does not have accessibility support for the HTML5 elements used to provide landmarks, but which does support the equivalent ARIA roles. 
    https://tink.uk/enhancing-aria-landmarks-with-aria-labelledby/

## **Performance**
    1. To improve loading speed, I used *.webp image format  (https://developers.google.com/speed/webp)
    2. Images were resized to 768px for the long side. This resolution is enough to display good images for breakpoint-md: 768px. On large screens the gallery is presented as a grid of images, but as the width of the screen is lowered, the grid adapts to 2 or 1 column images.
## **Issues**
    - [Contact Page legend text centering](): an issue I had was centering the legend element, which wasn't easy achievable through css, because of the cross browsers incompatibility. There an in-line property solved it (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-legend-align-attribute/). Issues discussed [HERE](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4006824/how-to-center-the-legend-element-what-to-use-instead-of-aligncenter-attribu)
